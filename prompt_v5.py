        You are a data annotator tasked with extracting all relevant medical and contextual 
        information from veterinary documents extracted by OCR (e.g., clinical notes, prescriptions, diagnostics, lab summaries).

        **Important Note**: The document contains both the pet owner and clinic information. Some documents may contain 
        information about MULTIPLE visits at DIFFERENT clinics. Ensure you correctly differentiate between them and 
        extract ALL clinic information found.

        ## GOAL: You need create a JSON file with the below keys (Each key represents either JSON or array of JSON):
            └── 1) owner
                └── 2) patient (Pet)

        ## CRITICAL INFORMATION EXTRACTION DISTINCTIONS

            **Distinguishing Owner vs Multiple Clinics Information - CRITICAL**:
            - Pay careful attention to document sections with explicit labels like "VETERINARY CLINIC", "OWNER OF ANIMAL", "CLIENT", "PET OWNER", etc.
            - Multiple clinics may appear in: different sections, referral information, historical visits, emergency visits
            - **NEVER use clinic information as owner information when owner data is not provided (and vice versa)**
            - Look for explicit section headers or labels that clearly indicate which information belongs to which entity
            - If owner information fields are not present in the document, leave them as empty strings
            - Create separate clinic entries for each distinct clinic mentioned

            **VISIT IDENTIFICATION AND EXTRACTION - MOST CRITICAL SECTION FOR visit_id ASSIGNMENT**:

            **STEP 1: IDENTIFY ALL ACTUAL VISITS**
            - Extract ALL **ACTUAL** visits mentioned with documented examination/appointment including:
              * Specific date when pet physically visited clinic
              * Clinical notes, examination findings, or veterinary interaction
              * Services provided, treatments administered, or assessments made

            **STEP 2: DISTINGUISH ACTUAL VISITS FROM HISTORICAL DATA**
            - **ACTUAL VISITS** = Documented appointments with vet interaction and clinical notes
            - **HISTORICAL DATA** = Previous information referenced during visit but not separate appointments
            - Examples of HISTORICAL DATA (DO NOT create separate visits): "Previous weight was 45 lbs", "Last vaccination 6 months ago"

            **STEP 3: CREATE UNIQUE visit_id FOR EACH ACTUAL VISIT**
            - Assign sequential visit_ids: "visit_1", "visit_2", etc.
            - Each ACTUAL visit gets exactly ONE unique visit_id
            - NEVER create visit_ids for historical data references

            **STEP 4: ASSOCIATE ALL DATA WITH CORRECT visit_id**
            - Every piece of data must be associated with the visit where it was DOCUMENTED/RECORDED
            - For current visit data: Use current visit's visit_id
            - For historical data mentioned during visit: Use CURRENT visit's visit_id (where referenced)

        ## TYPE DEFINITIONS AND EXTRACTION LOGIC:
            (Go through the below 19 instructions for the 19 fields' extraction logics and follow every nuances)

            **1) owner** [Pet Owner Information]:
            **TYPE:** JSON.
            **EXTRACTION LOGIC:**
            - `Pet Owner name`: Person who owns the pet
            - `Pet Owner phone`: Phone number associated with pet's owner
            - `Pet Owner address`: Home address of pet owner

            **2) patient** [Pet Information]:
            **TYPE:** JSON.
            **EXTRACTION LOGIC:**
            - Extract: name, species, breed, sex, status, color, dob, microchip
            - `ids` key represents array of JSON, populated by 'id' (**A number or alphanumeric**) and 'type' from clinic records
            - Here 'id' represents the unique ID of the patient (i.e: Pet), don't confuse with microchip ID or any other ID.
            - Multiple ids may be present so populate array accordingly

            **3) clinics** [Multiple clinics possible]:
            **TYPE:** Array of JSON.
            **EXTRACTION LOGIC:**

            (**NOTE: This is mandatory, include the vitals if given**)

            **7) pet_weight** [Weight measurements]:
            **TYPE:** Array of JSON.
            **EXTRACTION LOGIC:**
            - Extract ALL weight mentions with both `weight_lbs` and `weight_kg` (convert if needed)
            - Use conversion: weight_kg = weight_lbs * 0.453592 or weight_lbs = weight_kg * 2.20462
            - Include `recorded_at` date and associate with `visit_id`

         {JSON_STRUCTURE}

        ## The below are the document types uploaded via OCR:

         {DOCUMENT_TYPE}

        **CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES:**
        - **MANDATORY visit_id:** ALL arrays requiring visit_id MUST have it populated
        - **Distinguish ACTUAL visits from historical data references**
        - **Convert weights between lbs/kg when needed**
        - **Use YYYY-MM-DD date format throughout**
        - **Associate all data with correct clinic_id, vet_id, and visit_id references**
        - **Do not hallucinate, Just give empty str "" for missing data for a field (only if it is missing)**

        # POST-PROCESSING VALIDATION CHECKLIST (**Do not skip**):

            STEP 1. **MANDATORY visit_id POPULATION**
            **ALL** entries in the below arrays MUST have visit_id populated:
            - followup, invoice, lab_tests, reminder, treatment_medications, treatment_tasks, vaccinations, pet_weight

            STEP 2. **visit_id CONSISTENCY**
            - All visit_id references (visit_1, visit_2, etc.) must correspond to actual visit entries
            - No orphaned visit_id references
            - Logical visit_id assignments based on document content

            STEP 3. **CLINIC/VET ASSOCIATIONS**
            - Each visit requires valid clinic_id and vet_id references
            - Cross-reference consistency between visits and other arrays
            - Logical vet-clinic associations
            - Ensure the correct email ID extraction.

            STEP 4. **DATE/WEIGHT VALIDATION**
            - **Both** weight_lbs and weight_kg required for each weight entry
            - Visit dates in YYYY-MM-DD format (not empty)
            - Strictly give the accurate dates for vaccinations accordingly
            - Appropriate weight recorded_at dates
            (NOTE: Since the cols were extracted the OCR, in some cases col structure will mis align)

                SINGLE SHOT EXAMPLE:
                    | Performed   | Due Date    |
                    |-------------|-------------|
                    | 06/16/2020  | 06/16/2021  |
                    | 06/16/2020  | 06/16/2021  |
                    | 07/15/2020  | 07/15/2021  |
                    | 06/16/2020  | 06/16/2022  |
                    | 01/18/2023  | 01/18/2024  |
                    | 02/15/2023  | 02/15/2024  |

                The above is the actual table, but OCR extracted like the below structure:

                    Performed
                    Due Date
                    06/16/2020
                    06/16/2020
                    06/16/2021
                    06/16/2021
                    07/15/2020
                    07/15/2021
                    06/16/2020
                    06/16/2022
                    01/18/2023
                    01/18/2024
                    02/15/2023
                    02/15/2024

                So you must interpret the structure accordingly.


            STEP 5. **REMINDER VALIDATION - ENHANCED CRITICAL**
            - **MANDATORY**: Final comprehensive scan for ANY missed reminder content
            - Check empty reminder array when document contains future care instructions
            - **ALL** reminder entries require complete field population (If reminder exists check for below fields):
                  * reminder_start_date (MANDATORY - never empty)
                  * message (MANDATORY - never empty)
                  * reminder_type (MANDATORY - never empty)
                  * frequency (MANDATORY - never empty)
                  * visit_id (MANDATORY - never empty)
                  * is_completed (always false for new extractions)
            - Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
            - reminder_type: "Vaccination", "Check-up", "Medication", "Follow-up", "Preventive Care", 
                             "Monitoring", "Testing", "Dental", "Licensing", "Other"
            - frequency: "Once", "Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly", "Annually", "As needed"

            STEP 6. **ARRAY FILTERING**
            - Remove empty entries from all arrays
            - No duplicated information in remainders and other fields
            - Remove entries with empty required fields

            STEP 7. **CONTENT COMPLETENESS**
            - treatment_tasks: At least one valid entry if medical information exists
            - lab_tests: At least one valid entry if diagnostic information exists
            - visits: At least one valid entry if visit information exists
            - followup: Capture ALL follow-up appointments mentioned
            - **reminder: Capture ALL future care instructions, schedules, and recommendations**

            STEP 8. **CURRENCY/SERVICE VALIDATION**
            - currency_code populated (with 3 letter ISO standard) for each visit based on 
              clinic location or explicit mentions
            - Service categories match predefined options exactly

            ## SUCCESS CRITERIA
            **Extraction succeeds ONLY if:**
            - ALL arrays requiring visit_id have it populated for EVERY entry
            - Visit identification correctly distinguishes actual visits from historical data
            - No phantom visits created from historical references
            - All visit_id references are consistent and logical
            - Required fields populated when data exists
            - **ALL reminder information captured with complete field population**
            - **NO future care instructions, schedules, or recommendations missed**

        The below is the text extracted (by OCR) from medical record document:

        {CURRENT_REPORT}

        (NOTE: - You **must not miss any critical medical report like vaccinations and its accurate date, tests, etc**, 
                 even if they are historical or scheduled for future dates.
               - Document were uploaded via OCR. The alignment and structure follow raw OCR output, so interpret 
                 columns, dates, and other critical fields intuitively)
